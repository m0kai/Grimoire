Notes on working with assembly.
### Compile source code
```bash
# compile source code in a.s to binary a
gcc -nostdlib -static a.s -o a
```
### Hashdump source code
```bash
# compile to binary
gcc -nostdlib -static a.s -o a

# create object dump of binary
# a-raw is the object dump file that will be created by command
objcopy --dump-section .text=a-raw a

# hex dump the object dump
hd a-raw
```
### The many ways to zero a register
```bash
# for the examples I use eax as the register, replace this with whichever register you are trying to zero out
# using 0 
mox eax, 0
and eax, 0

push 0
pop rax

# not using 0 
xor eax, eax
sub eax, eax

# divide eax to get a 1, then sub 1
# divide eax to get a 1, then dec 1

# not sure about the following
# bit shifting
# If you shift the bits all the way off the register, whatever was there falls off and the bits don't wrap, so you push zeros onto the register and push off whatever was there.
# shift left
shl eax, 32 # 32 bit
shl rax, 64 # 64 bit

#shift right
shr eax, 32
shr rax, 64
```
