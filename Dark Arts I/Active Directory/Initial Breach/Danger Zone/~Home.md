The vectors may not necessarily be directly related to #ActiveDirectory, but they can give you a win in a pinch. These are considered more dangerous attacks that require thought and consideration before attempting them because you can end up taking down an entire domain/domain controller if you aren't careful. So ask client for direct written verification before running an attack, don't just wildly fling them at a system.
