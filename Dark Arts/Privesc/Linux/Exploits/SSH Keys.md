#### Enum
![[Looting SSH keys#^0c63ec]]
If you find a private key (`id_rsa`), and you can cat it, then copy+paste it to your attack box.
#### login
```bash
# from attackbox
# you will likely need to set the right permissions on the private key first:
# either will likely work.
chmod 600 id_rsa
chmod 700 id_rsa

# login using key
ssh -i <private key> <user>@<target ip>
ssh -i id_rsa ubuntu@10.10.10.10
```
