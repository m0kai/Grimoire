meterpreter easy mode magic, going to put it here to explain what it does and can do, but will not be helpful (too much) for OSCP. 

[Indepth explanation blog post](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/what-happens-when-i-type-getsystem)
They all basically use impersonation to try to get system.
technique 1:
Creates a numbed pipe from meterpreter, creates and runs a service that runs cmd.exe /c echo "some data" to the named pipe, when cmd connects to the named pipe, meterpreter impersonates the security context, which results in SYSTEM. 

technique 2:
Does the same thing as technique one except it writes a DLL to disk then hash rundll32.exe run the DLL dropped to disk. Can get flagged by AV easily.

technique 3:
uses SeDebugPrivileges then loops through services to find one running as system that it can inject itself into, then uses reflective DLL injection to run elevator.dll in the memory space of the hijacked service. 
```powershell
# from a meterpreter shell
getsystem # runs all 3
getsystem -t 1 # only first technique
getsytem -t 2 # only second technique
getsystem -t 3 # only third technique
```
