#### Spawn Shell
```powershell
# Spwan shell
# may throw an error and still work
# will likely not show anything so test by type whoami
bash.exe
```
#### Get TTY
or google another method if python doesn't work or look at this [cheatsheet](https://netsec.ws/?p=337)
```bash
# get a nicer normal shell
python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
/bin/bash -i 
/bin/bash
```
Then you can just shift to [[Dark Arts/Privesc/Linux/Enumeration/~Home|Linux Privesc]]
#### History
```bash
# look for creds
history
cat .bash_history
```
#### Use creds
if you found credentials, then you can use them to get onto the machine elevated:
- [[psexec]]
- smbexec
- [[wmiexec]]
