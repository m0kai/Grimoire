[[Dark Arts/Privesc/Windows/Enumeration/CVE-2019-1388|Enum]]
#### Vuln software
You may want to look on the filesystem or specifically check the recycle bin if possible to find: `hhupd.exe`

You can probably find this vulnerable software on google, download it, then [[Windows|file transfer]] it over to the target box.
#### Exploit
1. Make sure Internet Explorer is **closed**
2. Take out of recycle bin if in it, or file transfer it over
3. Right-click on the executable and check the properties to make sure no security properties are implemented on it. 
4. right-click the executable and select `Run as administrator`
5. UAC will pop up and block you, but that's okay. Click on `Show more details`
6. Then, click on `Show information about the publisher's certificate`
7. Click the link under `Issued by:` field, may say `Verisign Commercial Software Publishers CA`
8. This should open Internet Explorer as `NT SYSTEM\SYSTEM` in the background, close out the certificate dialog box and the UAC prompt. Internet Explorer will stay open. 
9. Hit settings, should be a cog on the top right of the browser window.
10. Select `File->Save as...`
11.  May produce an error dialog, hit okay and ignore it
12. under `File name:`, put in: `c:\windows\system32\*.*`
13. Find `cmd.exe`
14. Right-click on `cmd.exe` and hit `Open`
15. And that should open a command line as `nt authority\system`
16. Verify with a quick `whoami`
