Get-DomainUser -Identity [user] -Domain [domain] | Select-Object -Property [properties]

Get-DomainUser -Identity mmorgan -Domain inlanefreight.local | Select-Object -Property name,samaccountname,description,memberof,whencreated,pwdlastset,lastlogontimestamp,accountexpires,admincount,userprincipalname,serviceprincipalname,useraccountcontrol

# Group Enum
# recurse shows inherited group membership, for example if you look for domain admins, and secadmins is a subset of domain admins, they get domain admin privs by being nested inside domain admins, this command will show situations such as that. 
Get-Domain Group Mmber -Identity "[group name]" -Recurse
Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recurse

# Enum Trust relationships
Get-DomainTrustMapping

# test local admin access on current machine, or remote machine
Test-AdminAccess -ComputerName [host]
Test-AdminAccess -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01

# Enum users with ServicePrincipalName set, i.e. Kerberoasting targets
Get-DomainUser -SPN -Properties samaccountname,ServicePrincipalName
```
