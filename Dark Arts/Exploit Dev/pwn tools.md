Python package to help with exploit development. Mixes assembly and python among a ton of other things.
### Basic Usage
```python
from pwn import *
context.arch = 'amd64' # set architecture to 64-bit assembly, defaults to 32 bit

my_sc = asm("""
	mov eax, 0x1337
	mov edi, 0xbeef
	push 0x61
	pop rax
			""")

print(disasm(my_sc)) # prints a "pretty" hashdump of above assembly code
```
### Check code for H bytes
You can programatically check code for bad bytes, such as the H byte:
```python
if b'H' in my_sc:
	print("BAD CHAR")
```
### Use gbd from python during execution
The following is the same as the top, but it will drop you into GDB with the shell code open defined in `gdb.debug_assembly()`:
```python
from pwn import *
context.arch = 'amd64'

# will drop into GDB from here.
gdb.debug_assembly("""
	mox eax, 0x1337 
	mov rdi, 0xbeef
	push 0x61
	pop rax
				   """)

if b'H' in my_sc:
	print("BAD CHAR FOUND!")

print(disasm(my_sc))
```
### Open challenge program and send it shellcode via python
Again, same code as before, but you open the challenge binary from python, and send the shellcode raw bytes to the challenge then drop into interactive mode
```python
my_sc = asm("""
	mox eax, 0x1337
	mov rdi, 0xbeef
	push 0x61
	pop rax
			""")

p = process("/challenege/challenge1") # start challenege
p.send(my_sc) # send challenge the my_sc shellcode to stdin of above program
p.interactive() # drop into interactive session w/ program defined above
```
###  Convert ASCII characters to and from hex equivalents
```python
# Pack
# pack takes hex value and outputs ASCII equivalent
# Functions:
# p8: Pack 1 byte, 8 bits
# p16: Pack 2 bytes, 16 bits
# p32: Pack 4 bytes, 32 bits
# p64: Pack 8 bytes, 64 bits

p8(0x61) # outputs: b'a', so you know 0x61 represents lowercase a in ASCII

# Unpack
# Opposite of pack, it unpacks a value from ASCII to HEX
# sizing is the same as above, just u8 instead of p8
hex(u8(0x63)) # outputs b'c', so you know 0x63 is the hex representation of 'c'
```
### Format strings
you can use format strings here the same as you would in any python code. 
```python
# the following is valid code
from pwn import *
context.arch = 'amd64'

my_sc = asm(f"""
			mov eax, 0x1337
			mov rdi, 0xbeef
			push {u8(b'c')}
			pop rax
			""")
```
