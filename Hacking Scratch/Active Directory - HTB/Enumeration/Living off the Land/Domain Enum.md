### Net
Defenders can very well monitor the use of `net`, so this can be very unstealthy depending on your context. For example, if a financial advisor at a company uses `net` commands, that would be suspect as their skills and job don't align with using a command line. 

*Note: you can replace the net command with the net1 command and get the same results while circumventing monitors and restrictions. It's the same command, different string.*
